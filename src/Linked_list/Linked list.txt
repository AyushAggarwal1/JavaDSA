Linked list

Uses of Linked list
- To implement Stacks and Ques
- Browser - shifting left and right - doubly linked list
- Image Gallery - shifting left and right - doubly linked list
- Music Player - shifting left and right - doubly linked list
- To implement Hash Map and Hash Set to handle channing (channing to handle collisions in hash map and hash set)


Linked List use to store data like - int, media, Image

Arrays vs Linked list

benefits of ll
    array memory size is continious
    ll mermory size is not continious
    so thats wht ll is efficientz

    in array we have initial the size of array
    in ll we dont have to initialize the size 

benefits of array
    arrays has indexing o(1)
    ll dont have indexing to access its members o(n)

for sorting - arrays
for deletion, insertion - linked list

doubly linked list = both forward and backward list
single linked list = forward list


Vector   : 1) when exceed array limit it will increased capacity by 100%. It waste lots of memory.
    2) Vector is thread safe.
    3) It is slow.    

ArrayList : 1) when exceed array limit it will increased capacity by 50%. It save memory.
    2) ArrayList is not thread safe.
    3) It is fast.
